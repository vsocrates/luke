test = "DCTN4 as a modifier of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in cystic fibrosis Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients is associated with worse long-term pulmonary disease and shorter survival, and chronic Pa infection (CPA) is associated with reduced lung function, faster rate of lung decline, increased rates of exacerbations and shorter survival. By using exome sequencing and extreme phenotype design, it was recently shown that isoforms of dynactin 4 (DCTN4) may influence Pa infection in CF, leading to worse respiratory disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of DCTN4 missense variants on Pa infection incidence, age at first Pa infection and chronic Pa infection incidence in a cohort of adult CF patients from a single centre.
